使用for循环制作字符画即使对初学Python的人而言也显得有些枯燥简单。因此我制作了可以自动将图片转化成字符画的算法。对我来说，这个脚本可以很好的练习如何在Python中使用二维矩阵，以及Tkinter。之所以现在公开这个脚本，是因为许多同学对这个脚本表达了好奇心，并且我想现在再公开它也不至于影响各位的学术诚信。还有一点，今后的Python课如果还有这个project的话，以后的学生可以试着找到这个脚本，用它提前绘制草稿，或许会对各位搭建自己的字符串有所帮助，毕竟很多学生可能对于拓展性的自学不是那么有兴趣XD。

Using a for-loop to make character drawings can be a little tedious and easy even for beginners of Python.So I made an algorithm that automatically converts pictures into character drawings.For me, this script is a good exercise in using two-dimensional matrices in Python and using Tkinter.The reason why this script is published now is that many students have expressed curiosity about this script, and I think it will not affect your academic integrity if it is published now.In addition, if there is still a project in Python class in the future, future students can try to find this script and use it to draw the draft in advance, which may be helpful for you to build your own string. After all, many students may not be so interested in the expansive self-study :)

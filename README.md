使用for循环制作字符画即使对初学Python的人而言也显得有些简单。因此我制作了可以自动将图片转化成字符画的算法。对我来说，这个脚本可以很好的练习如何在Python中使用二维矩阵，以及Tkinter。

Using a for-loop to make character drawings can be a little tedious and easy even for beginners of Python.So I made an algorithm that automatically converts pictures into character drawings.For me, this script is a good exercise in using two-dimensional matrices in Python and using Tkinter.The reason why this script is published now is that many classmates have expressed curiosity about this script, and I think it will not affect anyone's academic integrity sence now.In addition, if there is still a project in Python class in the future, future students can find this script and use it to draw the draft in advance, which may be helpful for you to build your own string. After all, many students may not be so interested in the expansive self-study :)
